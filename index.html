                <p>The smallest cat in the world, about the size of a six month old domestic cat, the rusty, like its name suggests, 
                    has short brownish-grey fur, overlaid by a rufous hue – though in Sri Lanka, it has a more russet colour. The cat’s 
                    face has two dark streaks that run along each cheek and four stripes extending above its eyes, back between the ears 
                    and then down along the shoulders, eventually tapering off to elongated spots. These elongated spots can also be seen
                    along its flanks as very faint rusty-brown spots and blotches. Its throat, chest and belly are stark white, and marked
                    with large black spots and bars, much like that of a leopard. It has small rounded ears, black soled feet, and a tail 
                    that is just about half its body length.<br><br>

            <h1>Our History</h1><br>
            
                <P> John Heinrich August Hagenbeck (15 October 1866, Hamburg —16 December 1940, Colombo) was a German animal dealer, 
                    a plantation owner in Ceylon and a writer of books. He was the originator of what is now Dehiwala Zoo in Colombo.
                    <br><br>
                    John was the eldest son from the second marriage of Carl Claes Gottfried Hagenbeck and thus a half-brother of Carl 
                    Hagenbeck, well known for his zoos. John worked for Carl Hagenbeck from 1881, transporting animals and travelling on 
                    his behalf. In 1886 he visited Ceylon and recruited people for Hagenbeck's Völkerschau or "human zoo". In 1891 he moved 
                    to Colombo and worked as a planter. He soon acquired rubber, cocoa and tea plantations. He also traded in animals. In 1914, 
                    at the start of the war, he moved to Indonesia to avoid internment and then fled to Germany. He started a film company in 
                    Berlin in 1918 which produced films on his travels. He also wrote several books.
                    <br><br>
                    The Hagenbecks had an animal catching station near Kilimanjaro and John accompanied Baron Axel Blixen for a hunt in the 
                    area. John was also a friend of Leonard Woolf who was briefly stationed in Hambantota.
                    <br><br>
                    In 1927 he returned to Colombo and started a zoo in Dehiwala in 1929. The zoo was sold to the British government in 1935 
                    and all his properties were seized in 1939 by the British. He died in Colombo in 1940.
